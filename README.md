On June 17, 2017 (early morning local time), the USS <i>Fitzgerald</i> (DDG-62) was involved in a collision with the MV <i>ACX Crystal</i> about 100 km from her homeport of Yokosuka, Japan. The collision caused significant damage to the <i>Fitzgerald</i>, killing seven sailors and injuring three, including the commanding officer. The investigation into the incident is still ongoing as of June 28th, 2017.

After hearing news of this incident, I was saddened and curious about what might have happened and began reading up on what was known about the incident at that time, and learning more about the USS <i>Fitzgerald</i> and the <i>Arleigh Burke</i>-class destroyers. The following summary is a simple size comparison of the two ships involved and a highlight of the surface level damages based on initial photographs.
